# Manual Skill Inheritance for P3FES
## Description
This mod allows players to manually select the skills their personas inherit during fusion, eliminating the need for skill rerolling and adding an extra layer of strategy to the game. Compatible with both 4:3 and 16:9 versions.

## Compilation
This mod is written in a custom language for PS2 cheats called CLPS2C, so the first step to compile this mod is to use the [CLPS2C-Compiler](https://github.com/NiV-L-A/CLPS2C-Compiler/tree/master).

However, in the current version of the compiler (1.0.1 at the time of writing), a bug causes the mod to compile incorrectly, resulting in a game crash during testing. To avoid this, you will need to use [alexankitty's](https://github.com/alexankitty) keystone pull request, which can be found [here](https://github.com/alexankitty/keystone). This ensures that the cheat compiles and runs correctly in the game.
